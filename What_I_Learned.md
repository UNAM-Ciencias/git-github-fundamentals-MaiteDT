#What I learned from git

Even if we've been using git from the start of the career, there's still a few things I didn't understand and some are clearer now. I didn't know which kind of *formatting* git used for the .md files. I knew github was more of a community but i wasn't aware you could actually interact a little, like *starring* another contibutor's repositories or following users.
